# flipr-classroom project
As the teacher, you can post the assignment to the whole class or to a student or group, or to one or more classes. You can set a due date and attach files for students to work on.
When you attach a Drive file (document, slides, or sheets), you can choose to:
Allow students to only view the file—Students can read the file but not edit it.
Allow students to edit the file—Students share the same file and each student can edit it.
Make a copy of the file for each student—Students get an individual copy of the file that has their name added to the document title, and they can edit it. When a student turns in the assignment, you see the file labeled with the student’s name.
As students work on an assignment, you can view their progress, add comments, and make edits in the documents.

Note: You have the same share options when you attach files to an announcement.
As a student, you can work on the assignment by viewing a document, editing a shared document, or editing your individual copy of a document. You can attach files, links, or images to your work. When finished, you turn in your work.
Before the due date, you can unsubmit work, make changes, and resubmit it. After you turn in a file from Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides, only the teacher can see and edit your work.

As the teacher, you can write notes on student work, add a grade, and return it with individual feedback for any student
As a student, you can see your grades. If your work includes a Drive file, you regain edit access to the file again and you can make improvements as required.
